# ACB reporting for ETFs

This project is the last project for the UWaterloo ECE 150 class of 2019 Fall.

The program reads a customer's exchange-traded funds(ETFs) transaction history from a provided file. And then sort the history by date and calculate the Capital Gain and Loss. Finally, generate an adjusted cost base (ACB) reporting for ETFs.
